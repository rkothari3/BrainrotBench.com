    "reasoning": "Image 1 is the best choice because it features a whimsical, well-lit butterfly lamp with a big, friendly smile and an overall animated, joyful appearance that aligns perfectly with the playful exclamation 'mamma mia, farfalla lampadina!' The glowing lights accentuate the butterfly wings, making it stand out and feel magical, which is great for capturing the surprise and delight in the Italian phrase."

    "reasoning": "Image 1 provides the most creative and relevant integration of the espresso machine with the elephant. The machine's steam nozzle replaces or augments the trunk, directly referencing both 'Caff\u00e8' (coffee) and the 'Tromba Forte' (Loud Trumpet) aspect through the steaming action, creating a strong visual metaphor."

The pun is immediately obvious, the composition is sharp, and the scene feels delightfully surreal, matching the Italian voice cue perfectly."

    "video_path": "public/openai_gpt-4.1_Polpastrella_Lampadina/Polpastrella_Lampadina_final.mp4",
    "reasoning": "Image 2 best represents the concept of 'Polpastrella Lampadina' with an octopus whose head is a clear light bulb, not only visibly glowing and sparking but also perfectly centered and vivid. The environment (colorful wires, cozy room with books and soft light in the background) highlights both the playful and inventive character appropriate for the cheerful Italian phrase 'Luccica polpastrella, mamma mia!'. The octopus looks lively, the lamp-bulb effect is striking, and the sparks convey the sense of 'luccica' (sparkle/shines)."

    "reasoning": "This image most clearly and humorously captures the portmanteau \u201cFrullafante\u201d by depicting an elephant (\u201celefante\u201d) inside a blender (\u201cfrulla\u201d), making the pun immediately obvious. The composition is high-quality, with the elephant\u2019s trunk and ears integrated into the blender scene, ensuring viewers instantly understand the playful concept."

    "reasoning": "Image 5 features a large black panther prominently positioned with its paw on a tractor tire, creating a strong visual combination of the two elements. The panther has a clear view of the camera while the tractor is well-defined, aligning with the phrase 'Pantherino Tractorino, che combinazione spettacolare!'. None of the other images are as high quality in comparison."

    "reasoning": "Image 5 provides the clearest and most balanced composition. The bear ('Orso') is centered and friendly-looking, and it holds two cones featuring multiple scoops and colors (pink, green, white), strongly conveying the 'Cremoso' (creamy) aspect with variety. The dropped ice cream adds a playful touch without distracting from the main subject. Compared to others, image 2 is too surreal, image 3 has oversized cones, image 1 has fewer flavors, and image 4's bear is slightly turned away."

    "reasoning": "Image 5 best represents the fun 'Gelatigrillo' concept by combining the look of a grasshopper with unmistakably vibrant, multicolored Italian gelato swirled on its body and a classic cone as its lower half. The two cherries on top add to the whimsical, 'mamma mia, gelatigrillo arrivato!' feeling, and the bright, sunlit piazza background emphasizes the Italian setting. Its playful colors, cone tail, and clear gelato-cherry details make it visually striking and memorable."

    "reasoning": "Image 3 is chosen as it best captures the essence of a 'Canguro Gondoliere' in action. The kangaroo wears the iconic striped shirt and straw hat, is positioned correctly in a gondola within a Venetian canal setting, and strikes a dynamic, welcoming pose with arms outstretched. This pose perfectly complements the accompanying Italian phrase 'Andiamo, bellissimi!', conveying enthusiasm and invitation. Images 2 and 5 have distracting anatomical oddities (the belly), image 4 features two kangaroos and a strange pose, while image 1 is more static compared to the chosen one."
